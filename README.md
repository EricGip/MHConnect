## Inspiration
In America, it’s estimated that 1 out of 5 adults experience mental illness each year,  the rate of depression among teens has increased over 60% in the last 10 years, suicide is now the second leading cause of death of those between 10-34, and federal data estimates 40-70 million Americans to experience depression & less than 50% seek help.. 

Coming from Asian immigrant families, we all grew up around a negative stigma among mental health, like it doesn't exist; we were all told “if you’re feeling sad, just drink more water and sleep early.” The statistics are there so we need to be the change we want to see in the world and start taking mental health seriously. We believed the best option for mental illness was the same as a physical illness -- seeking professional help. 

While the rate of mental illness is rising, there are even more barriers for those who are seeking  help. In the U.S., 51% of counties do not have a psychiatrist. Also, recently revealed strategies suggest that insurance companies intentionally keep their customers away from getting help which tactics such as not keeping accurate records of psychiatrist, in one study only 26/100 numbers were legit psychiatrist offices. These are insurance referrals have been coined “Ghost Networks”.
