We created this project using AdobeXD for the wire framing of a mobile app and web page. React, React-Native, and other component libaries were used for the front end (Chibird.com for the artwork). For the backend, we wanted to use the sponsor BlockStack for a trust system of psychiatrists and patients but none of the mentors had experience with it unforunately. We moved to GCP FireBase with this option. 

I personally did the full stack, I made the front end web app and mobile app with Javascript, React, and React Native. After a front end MVP, I jumped to help out the backend and we decided on FireStore/Firebase to be able to get patient data in a Key:value pair and implement a matching algorithm from there. 

Our goal was to make a mobile App that matches you with a psychiatrist even when given difficult circumstances. They would be in your area, match your preferences so you would be completely comfortable with them, even with the worst social anxieties, and most importantly accept your health insurance as some practices can charge up to $300 / hour. 

Our idea was to Sign in -> Get asked a series of questions / Fill out your profile -> We use an algorithm to match you with some psychiatrist that you would like -> then you search through a list and maybe even message them directly if the platform would interest enough patients and doctors.

Ideally on a mobile app for the ease of access but given our time restraint we believed it was best for a web app.
